# Humble Bundle Link Copier
Have you ever wanted to download every file from a bundle you've purchased on Humble Bundle, only to find that their "Bulk Download" button is inconsistent at best? This GreaseMonkey/TamperMonkey user script is for you.

Humble Bundle Link Copier adds a button at the top of the download list that copies every download link to your clipboard. You can then use a utility of your choice - such as [JDownloader](https://board.jdownloader.org/showthread.php?t=54725) or [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html) - to easily download every file at once.
